Project 4 : Software Development Tools
I choose to create an app that could compare similar pitches in baseball.
I downloaded the pitch arsenal data from https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/.
The idea was to combine velocity and movement data from different pitch types with the outcome of the pitches. 
By filtering the data based on a similar range of characteristics, you can group outcomes and get an idea of what attributes might be more favorable to increase efficiency.
