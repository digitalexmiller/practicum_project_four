# # **MLB Pitch Type Analysis**
# 
# ## How velocity and movement effects outcome
# 
# ### This goal of this exercise is to create a web app for users to easily group and display outcomes between pitch types with similar components. The idea is that once a user selects the pitch type, s/he can filter the average pitch by every pitcher by its velocity, horizontal and vertical movement. Once the filters are made, a table of the filtered pitches and a scatterplot of how these pitches perform under various metrics (whiff rate, woba and expected runs/100) will also be made available.
# 
# ### Additionally, a histogram will be made available to display full pitch-types vs. their outcomes.
# 
# #### The velocity slider is a raw number, but the movement sliders are based on a percentage rank of how much each pitch moves based on the pitch type

# #### Conclusions and future update potential
# I'm generally very happy with the app and streamlit. For the most part I was able to achieve the goals that I targetted. I've even used the webapp with friends to test real life comparisons and it seems accurate. <br> Unfortunately, I was unable to add trendlines to the scatterplots. I think there is a bug in the streamlit compatibility because the attribute (trendline="ols") would work with a call on the fig1, but not when called through streamlit. This trendline would make the analysis of the correlation between outputs and inputs much easier. It's something I want to try to explore in the future to update the project with. <br> I'd like to update this dataframw with 2023 pitches as they become available and explore a way for the df to be automatically downloaded via api.
